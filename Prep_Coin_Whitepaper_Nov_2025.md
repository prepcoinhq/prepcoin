3a. Transparency & Wallet Allocation  
Prep Coin™ prioritises audit‑safe clarity. The following wallets and accounts hold the largest allocations of PREP and Prep‑STK:

- **Founders’ Wallet** – `BRwFRoHKF7AaCVpKhSwiXcrhW7hPU4dWg3Hstqy3VDm6`  
  Holds 20% supply, vested over 12 months. Locked until 18 November 2025 as requested by Cyberscope.  

- **Liquidity Wallet** – `B3uq1HgaoT9EtPg14HeWGujZFzR22RkE7znGSbebRG7S`  
  Provides liquidity depth, stabilises trading, and reduces slippage for contributors.  

- **Presale Lock Wallet** – `PLockmwUF82vkr8koh8CSbrbjhBuao2TT9N69RmGRQ4`  
  Holds locked liquidity for 365 days post‑presale. Appears as top holder on DEX charts but is a contract lock, not a private wallet.  

- **Staking Rewards Wallet** – `5vbnLfvtqrgndNwyzS81ewq4XT7QbNsd28gnyE5FgojZ`  
  Distributes Prep‑STK rewards earned from staking PREP. Used for governance voting, shop discounts, and contributor incentives.  

- **Staking Deposit Account (program‑controlled)** – `CzRTaj61swXDd8izNGw5SytSud8GaKPxCAw9rj2SwpTk`  
  Receives staked PREP via the Rust‑built Solana staking program. Balances are aggregated by the program and may not appear as individual wallet transfers on explorers, but reflect pooled deposits (currently ~90,000 PREP).  

- **Raydium Vault Authority Wallet** – `GpMZbSM2GgvTKHJirzeGfMFoaZ8UR2X7F4v8vHTvxFbL`  
  Operated by Raydium as Vault Authority #2. Supports automated liquidity management and pool stability.
